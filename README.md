# To determine wine quality

The Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems at the University of California, Irvine manages the Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).  Task is to analyze the Wine Quality dataset which is made available in the WineQuality.csv.  The target variable is quality_grp which is binary.  Its values are 0 or 1.  The input attributes are: (1) fixed_acidity, (2) volatile_acidity, (3) citric_acid, (4) residual_sugar, (5) chlorides, (6) free_sulfur_dioxide, (7) total_sulfur_dioxide, (8) density, (9) pH, (10) sulphates, and (11) alcohol.

Will be implementing the t test algorithm and will also calculate the two sided p value. Will be implementing the SVM classifier to asses the wine quality.
